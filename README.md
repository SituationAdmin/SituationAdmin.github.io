## How to use Situation Admin
Situation admin is very easy to use, first you will need an executor for roblox for this we would recommend either 'SynapseX' or 'Script-Ware' the link for both is listed above once you have installed the executor simply copy and paste the code below into your executor and click 'execute'.
Type 'Help' into the console once executed for a list of commands, currently over 30 commands with more coming soon
## How to use Plugins
A folder named "situation_plugins" will be created upon execution.
To create a plugin you will need to create a new file such as command_name.lua.
Situation admin will treat every lua file within the folder as a function, whatever is inside the file is what is gets ran whenever you execute the command.
The name of the file will be what the command is called for example if the file is named "HelloWorld.lua" or "HelloWorld.txt" to run the command you would type "HelloWorld" in the input, commands are not case sensitive therefore you could also type "HeLLoWoRLd" and the command would still run.
